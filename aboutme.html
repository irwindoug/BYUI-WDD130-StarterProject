      <h2>Douglas Irwin</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Doug Irwin and I am husband and father to two boys and a girl. While we currently live in Idaho Falls, ID, we've moved 14 times between Utah, California, and Idaho in the last 5 years! You can say that we love traveling to new places (though weâ€™re still working on enjoying long car rides).</p>
      <p>Right now, I am studying online at Brigham Young University - Idaho in Applied Technology with a certificate in Entrepreneurship, but I hope to earn my MBA with an emphasis on cybersecurity at ISU in the future. I also work as an IT support subcontractor for a company called Idaho National Laboratory, which is mostly known for it's research in nuclear energy, being the first place in the world to power a submarine via nuclear energy!</p> 
      <p>
      When I'm not working or playing with my kids, I am tinkering with my home server. I love being able to design things that simplifies complex problems and redundant tasks, especially when it helps save time so people (like myself) can spend less time on redundant tasks and more time on more important things like family and friends.</p>
