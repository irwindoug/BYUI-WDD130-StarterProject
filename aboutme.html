      <h2>Douglas Irwin</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Doug Irwin and currently live in Rexburg, ID with my wife and two boys. I am majoring in Applied Technology and taking coursework towards a degree in Applied Business Management. While I grew up in Kaysville, UT, since I have been married, my wife and I have moved 10 times between Utah, California, and Idaho, with us moving 4 times just last year! You can say that we love traveling to new places (though weâ€™re still working on enjoying long car rides).</p>
      <p>Currently, I work for a Conservice, a billing company that compiles utility bills for apartment residents, as a billing processor, but I am currently working towards moving towards becoming a software programmer. I love being able to design code that simplifies complex problems and tasks! Especially when it helps save time so people (like myself) can spend less time on redundant tasks and more time on more important things like friends and family.</p>
